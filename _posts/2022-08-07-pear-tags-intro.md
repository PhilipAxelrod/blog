## AirTag suck, and we need better alternatives 
My excitement for Apple's AirTags was summarily crushed upon realizing AirTags are not Android compatible.
While there are AirTag equivalents for non-iPhones such as Tile,
they don't work nearly as well. 
There's a simple reason for this.

Trackers like AirTags and Tiles work by pinging nearby smartphones over bluetooth.
These phones then send their location data to Apple's and Tile's respective servers, who in turn make this location data
available to the owner of the tracker. 
Thus, as long as a participating phone is physically near the tracker, the tracker's owner can infer the location of the
tracker from the location of the nearby phone.
AirTags work so well because everyone with an iPhone is forced to participate in this system.
Thus, an iPhone will almost always be near your AirTag, so you can almost always know your AirTag's location.

In contrast,
the only participating phones in Tile's similar network are those of other Tile owners. This network
is much smaller: In the entire Santa Barbara area,
there are only about 1,500 Tile owners.

So I did what any reasonable, self-respecting, and normal person would do in my situation: 
I set out to design and build my own location tracker that will work with Android phones, avoid
Tile's mistakes, and be cleverly named. 
Join me on this adventure to create PearTags!

## PearTags Will Use Wi-Fi Signals
Unlike AirTags, my tracker will not have a large network of GPS enabled iPhones to rely on for location measurements. 
Instead, PearTags will have to take their own measurements with their own sensors and calculate their locations
using their own processors.
From my literature review, there are three main options for measurements that PearTags could make
while maintaining a small form factor tracker and without unusual requirements such as nearby routers with 8+ antennas and/or routers that implement the IEEE 802.11mc standard:

* Satellite GPS data
* Cell tower signal strengths 
* Wi-Fi router signal strengths

While GPS can be fairly accurate in outdoor locations, it wouldn't work well for PearTags.
In indoor locations, GPS devices can't connect to as many GPS satellites as they can outdoors, greatly reducing their
accuracy indoors.

I also looked into using cell tower data because cell signal functions consistently in most outdoor *and* indoor locations.
By measuring the strength of a cell signal from a particular tower, one can measure the distance from that tower.
Repeat that process with three different cell towers, and you get three circles whose intersection reveals the tracker's location.
This is known as "triangulation," or "cell signal triangulation" in this case.

Unfortunately, this method tends to have an accuracy in the tens of meters.
This might help me find which building I left my jacket in, but nothing more accurate than that.

Finally, PearTags could measure Wi-Fi signal strengths.
Unfortunately, Wi-Fi signals use a lower wavelength than cell signals, which means that
physical objects like walls significantly weaken and reflect Wi-Fi signals. 
This leads to inaccurate measurements of the distance from the device to the router.
Using triangulation with these distance measurements leads to an accuracy as poor as 5 meters [\[1\]](https://web.stanford.edu/~skatti/pubs/sigcomm15-spotfi.pdf).

A strategy known as Wi-Fi fingerprinting overcomes this obstacle by 
not considering distance in the first place.
With Wi-Fi fingerprinting, "fingerprints" of Wi-Fi signal strengths (aka, RSSIs or Received Signal Strength Intensity) are recorded
onto a map.
When a device wants to find its current location, it measures its Wifi "fingerprint" (ie the RSSIs of nearby routers) and compares them to a
map of previously collected "fingerprints."
The fingerprint on the apriori map that is closest to the current fingerprint is assumed to be the device's location.
Fancier Wi-Fi algorithms can get more precise location estimates by interpolating between nearby fingerprints. The best Wi-Fi fingerprinting implementations can achieve a minimum accuracy of 1.3 meters and functions well indoors [\[1\]](https://web.stanford.edu/~skatti/pubs/sigcomm15-spotfi.pdf), which is why I 
ultimately decided to use it for PearTags.

## A simple sanity check
Before collecting tons of data, thinking about fancy algorithms, and writing tons of code, I figured I should start small. 
I'd first explore and implement Wi-Fi fingerprinting in a simple and small context, just in my house.
This way, I can identify simple problems more easily without distracting myself with the more
complicated challenges associated with larger areas. 

The first thing I did was a sanity check.
In particular, I wanted to know if there are distinguishable differences between a Wi-Fi 
fingerprint in my kitchen, living room, and dining room.
 
The first thing I did was measure RSSIs with my laptop in various rooms in my house. I set about placing my laptop in various parts of my house, collecting 2 minutes worth of RSSI data.
A blog post about the scripting necessary to achieve this task coming soon! 
Below is a crude drawing I made of several rooms in my house:

And here are my measurements of RSSIs from my neighbor's Wi-Fi
at various locations!

Tada! While my laptop could detect about 10 networks, I am only showing data for two of them for the sake of visualization. On the x-axis is data on my own network, and on the y-axis is data from one of my neighbor's networks. 
We would hope to see that each color cluster is clearly separated the clusters. In fact, the entrance bench (light blue), garage entrance (brown), and kitchen sink do seem to be fairly distinct. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the other locations. 
For example, the piano area (red) and the living room tv area (blue) have significant overlap, and I would need data from more networks to distinguish between them. 
It's worth noting the discrete nature of the data, rather than the continuous variation one would expect from a physical phenomenon. 
This is just an artifact from airodump-ng, the tool I use to gather this data, rounding its measurements to the nearest integer.

The cluster separation, or the lack thereof, might be hard to see with so many colors at once, so I've created seven graphs, each highlighting one location at a time

Note how the couch, garage entrance, kitchen sink, and entrance have a fair bit of separation. These locations are about 10 feet away from each other, so it's promising that with just 2 networks, we can differentiate between locations that are about feet away from each other. 

Hopefully, information about other networks will be sufficient to identify the living room (blue), couch (black), and piano (red) areas.
The following graphs are made with data about my local network and a different neighbor's network:
![](/assets/images/Separate%20graphs%20for%20each%20location%20new%20network.png)
Thankfully, we do get a fair amount of separation in those areas when we include this new network! Thus, with 3 networks, there is enough data to classify 7 areas of my house approximately 5 feet apart.

## Conclusion and future work
The primary concern when creating an air-tag alternative is finding the appropiate data source to calculate location. After comparing several different options and collecting some data around my house, I was able to verify that Wi-Fi network strength contains sufficient information for localization with accuracy within several feet. 

There are several more steps to translate this into a fully functional air-tag alternative. First, I have to train and test a machine learning algorithm to make estimates with this data. In my next post, I'll compare how well support vector machines, neural networks, and simple gaussian distributions compare for this application.

However, this algorithm would only classify several discrete locations. This makes sense because it's easy to label training data this way. All I have to do is set my laptop down, write down the location, and wait for a couple minute's worth of data. Unfortunately, PearTags won't always be in one of several, very specific locations. I am not going to always forget my keys  on the left couch cushion where I collected training data. If I leave my keychain sporting a PearTag on the living room table, I'll want a more accurate estimate than "near the couch."

Thus, the next step will involve a second algorithm to interpolate a more precise location from the first algorithm's classification. Existing methods such as the Horus fingerprinting algorithm use weighted averages for this interpolation. For example, if the classifier says there's 50% chance a fingerprint came from the couch, and 50% chance it came from the TV, the Horus algorithm would estimate that the location is midway between the couch and the TV. I hope that using more sophisticated methods will yield better results. For example, an appropriately trained neural network might have a hidden layer that can estimate whether there is a wall between the couch and the kitchen sink, and it could use this estimate to come up with a more accurate interpolation
