## Welcome to my tech blog!

I am a recent graduate with a B.S. in mathematics from the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara, but my interests are not limited to just math. If you're interested in data science, artificial intelligence, scripting, or spatial localization, you'll probably find something interesting in about my tech projects. Checkout my blog posts below!
